## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ksaurav1105/HTML_WEB_HOST/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

# Understanding the Concept of Github Pages
## Github Pages Can be used to Host HTML files on Web Page directly without any servers.
### Github Pages reduces the use of Web servers and container to host our HTML file on Web Page.

Steps to host html or a .md file on the Web:-
- Create a repository and keep the html file or .md file in the Github repository.

- In the pages we select the branch where we need to apply and the location of the file which needs to be hosted on web.In our case it is root.
- We can also choose theme. I have chosen Jekyll Theme which gives a nice background and presentation to the web page.

We can follow below steps to check in the new code or changes:-
1. **Make direct changes in the main branch which is set in the Github Page**
2. _Or Create a separate branch, make changes there and then push the changes to the main branch which is set for Github pages, the changes willnow displayed on the new Web page after refresh._
3. `The changes will not apply to the separate branch. It will be applied only once the separated branch is merged to main branch.`

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ksaurav1105/HTML_WEB_HOST/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
